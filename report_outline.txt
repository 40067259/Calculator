Iteration 1
1. Documentation (DELIVERABLE 1: due June 08 @ 23:00):
    1) collaboration patterns followed;
    2) selected functions;
    3) initial list of potential personas;
    4) list of interview questions and answers;
    5) initial set of use cases;
    6) an outline of the strategy, including algorithm(s) expressed as
       pseudcode or otherwise in some 'standard' form and data structures, used
       for implementation, inclusions and exclusions for Iteration 1 (to be
       addressed in Iteration 2), and technical reasons for making decisions
       (such as, those for inclusions and exclusions);
       note: there is decision-making throughout development. For example,
             a given function can usually be computed in more than one way.
             It is acceptable to reduce the set of choices to not more than
             three. In the end, this leads to selecting one option from a
             given set of choices, knowing that each choice has its own
             advantages and disadvantages.
    7) source code review results (if any);
    8) test results;
    9) instructions on how to run the program;

2. Source code.

3. Data files (if any).

4. A copy of the presentation slides (DELIVERABLE 2: due June 05 @ 16:15
   - a presentation of how the development is organized;
     and a demonstration of an initial version (prototype) of ETERNITY
     in the class).
